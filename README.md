# Enhancing Vegetation Classification thorugh hyperspectral remote sensing: Objective and Methodological approach
## Introduction:
Recent developments in remote sensing technology have led to a significant rise in the demand for
precise and reliable algorithms for analyzing hyperspectral remote sensing images. Hyperspectral
remote sensing offers a powerful tool for monitoring and classification of vegetation types with
unprecedented spectral resolution. This work involves classification of hyperspectral images using
different methodological approaches. This involves 3 steps. Firstly, classification of hyperspectral images using Support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). Secondly, principal
component analysis (PCA) is utilized for dimension reduction of the hyperspectral image and then
reduced features are trained by SVM and RF. The PCA + SVM and PCA + RF methods are compared with the SVM and RF and it is observed that the PCA + SVM method gives better results in terms of classification accuracy
## Objectives of the work:
- Optimization of spectral bands
- Feature extraction
- Classification Algorithms Comparision
- Spatial Resolution Analysis
